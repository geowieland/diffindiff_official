# diffindiff: A Python library for convenient difference-in-differences analyses

This Python library is designed for performing Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analyses in a convenient way. It allows users to construct datasets, define treatment and control groups, and set treatment periods. DiD model analyses may be conducted with both datasets created by built-in functions and ready-to-use external datasets. Both simultaneous and staggered adoption are supported. The library allows for various extensions, such as two-way fixed effects models, group- or individual-specific effects, post-treatment periods, and triple-difference estimations. Additionally, it includes functions for visualizing results, such as plotting DiD coefficients with confidence intervals and illustrating the temporal evolution of staggered treatments. Furthermore, several functions for rigorous treatment setting and data diagnostics are incorporated.

    )
# Creating DiD dataset by defining groups and treatment time

curfew_data.summary()
# Summary of created treatment data

curfew_model.plot(
    y_label="Cumulative infections per 100,000",
    plot_title="Curfew effectiveness - Groups over time",
    plot_observed=True
    )
# Plot observed vs. predicted (means) separated by group (treatment and control)

curfew_model.plot_effects(
    x_label="Coefficients with 95% CI",
    plot_title="Curfew effectiveness - DiD effects"
    )
# plot effects

counties_DE=pd.read_csv("data/counties_DE.csv", sep=";", decimal=",", encoding='latin1')
# Dataset with German county data

curfew_data_withgroups = curfew_data.add_covariates(
    additional_df=counties_DE, 
    unit_col="county",
    time_col=None, 
    variables=["BL"])
# Adding federal state column as covariate

curfew_model_withgroups = curfew_data_withgroups.analysis(
    GTE=True,
    group_by="BL")
# Model analysis of created data

curfew_model_withgroups.summary()
